Representatives from EU member states unanimously voted Friday to advance the Artificial Intelligence Act, a pioneering law to regulate AI use and development. This act focuses on safety, transparency, and fairness, particularly for high-risk AI in sectors like healthcare and law enforcement. It's a significant step towards responsible AI innovation. This rubber-stamps the political agreement reached in December 2023. The European Parliament's Internal Market and Civil Liberties Committees will adopt the act on 13 February, followed by a plenary vote provisionally scheduled for 10-11 April. The formal adoption will then be complete with endorsement at the ministerial level. The act will then enter into force 20 days after publication in the official journal. This could well set a global precedent.
