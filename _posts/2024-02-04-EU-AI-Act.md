Representatives from EU member states unanimously voted Friday to advance the Artificial Intelligence Act, a pioneering law to regulate AI use and development. This act focuses on safety, transparency, and fairness, particularly for high-risk AI in sectors like healthcare and law enforcement. It's a significant step towards responsible AI innovation. Formal adoption is pending, but this could set a global precedent.
